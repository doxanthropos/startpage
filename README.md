# startpage
A simple website, that will be a personal alternative to the startpages, provided by current web browsers.

It is possible to access it online here: [https://doxanthropos.github.io/startpage/](https://doxanthropos.github.io/startpage/)

## How do I edit this?

I use the [Open With](https://darktrojan.github.io/openwith/) browser extension to open websites in different programmes and one of the options, that I have configured is to open in a text editor. This obviously only works with html files that are accessed from the file system and not from the web, so I have set my browsers starting page to be the local version.
